// This file decides what an export says about itself when the graph it
// describes was read from other documents (ADR-0037, issue #396).
//
// The rule turns on how many documents were ingested and, for exactly one,
// on whether the export still restates it, because both formats give a
// document exactly one identity:
//
//   - none: a native scan. Bomly asserts everything itself; nothing here
//     applies.
//   - one, restated: a conversion. The document restates that source's
//     assertions, identity included, so `export -> ingest -> export`
//     reproduces its own bytes -- the fixed point #396 asks for.
//   - one, transformed: a scope filter, enrichment, or degraded resolution
//     changed the graph between ingest and export, so the document is a new
//     one with a single input. It behaves as a merge of one: its own
//     identity, timestamp, name and comment, with the source *linked*
//     (issue #433). Only the caller can tell this case from the previous
//     one, and says so through BuildOptions.RestatesSource.
//   - many: a merge. The document is a new one and says so: it keeps its own
//     identity and *links* each source instead of adopting one of them.
//
// Creators and tools union in every case, which is the SDK's declared merge
// class for them: two documents having produced this one is the normal case
// and both deserve credit.

// DocumentAssertionsFor returns the record of what a source document asserted
// about itself, for attaching to the graph entry that document became.
//
// It is never nil for a document that was read, even one that asserted
// nothing. The presence of the record is itself a fact -- that this entry came
// from an SBOM -- and a merged export needs it: CycloneDX permits a document
// with neither a serial number nor metadata, and treating that as "no source"
// made a merge of two documents look like a conversion of one, publishing the
// merged inventory under the other document's identity.

// by both remembering the same rule.

// namespace into the model and then writes a freshly minted serial, because
// CycloneDX has no namespace slot -- so comparing against the namespace
// suppressed the link for a document that had not in fact adopted anything,
// and the export named its source neither way.

// Each source contributes two things: its own link tuple, and the tuples it
// recorded for the documents *it* was built from. That second half is what
